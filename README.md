 🍬 Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction System** built using **Machine Learning**. Users can input personal health parameters, and the app predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes.

---

## Features

- User-friendly **web interface** using Streamlit
- Input health parameters such as:
  - Age, Gender
  - Blood Pressure
  - Glucose Level
  - BMI
  - Insulin, etc.
- **Predicts diabetes** using pre-trained ML models
- Provides probability and result (Positive/Negative)

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Processing**:
   - Input values are collected from the user
   - Preprocessed to match ML model requirements

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Predicts likelihood of diabetes
   - Uses trained models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or others depending on your implementation)

3. **Streamlit Frontend**:
   - Simple interface to input data and get predictions instantly
   - Displays results in a readable format

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes_Prediction_App.git
   cd Diabetes_Prediction_App
Create a virtual environment & install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Streamlit App:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the app in your browser, input your health parameters, and get the prediction!

Notes
This is a predictive tool and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Ensure input values are accurate for reliable predictions.

ML model performance depends on the quality of the training data.

If you want, I can also make a **more professional version** with **badges, GIF screenshot, and a visually appealing header** just like top GitHub repos.  

Do you want me to do that?
